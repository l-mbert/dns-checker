# DNS Checker

This is a simple tool to check DNS records for a given domain.

This is mostly for my own use, but feel free to use it if you want.

## Features

- Check DNS records for a given domain
- Check different record types (A, AAAA, MX, NS, PTR, TXT)
- Check on an interval
- Add tests to check for specific values (equal, contains, etc.)
